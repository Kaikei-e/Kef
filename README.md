# Kef

Kef is a lightweight and simple Web Application Framework prototype. It pursues minimal implementation and does not aim to provide everything. However, it is designed to achieve elegance through the combination of simple modules.

Warning: This repository has strong experimental elements and is authored by inexperienced Elixir developers. Nevertheless, the philosophy is clear - 'simplicity', and that's it. This framework will not burden users with unnecessary tasks. It seeks simplicity above all else.
